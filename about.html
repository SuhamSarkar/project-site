                <br>
                <br>
                Our journey began with a simple idea: to design a machine that would make a positive impact on the
                world. We brainstormed and debated, drawing on our individual experiences and expertise to shape the
                concept. We knew that we wanted our machine to be innovative, efficient, and sustainable - and we were
                determined to make it a reality.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The design process was challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. We faced numerous obstacles along the
                way, from budget constraints to technical limitations. But we persevered, working long hours and
                collaborating closely to find solutions to each problem. We engaged with industry experts, sought out
                advice from our professors, and conducted extensive research to ensure that we were creating a machine
                that was both feasible and impactful.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                As we moved from the design phase to the construction phase, our team members stepped up once again. We
                worked tirelessly to bring the machine to life, with each member contributing their unique skill sets.
                Some of us focused on the mechanical components, while others tackled the electrical systems. We worked
                with precision and care, knowing that each detail would impact the performance of the machine.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The testing phase was perhaps the most exciting, as we saw our vision come to life before our eyes. We
                were thrilled to see the machine working smoothly and efficiently, meeting and exceeding our
                expectations. Our hard work had paid off, and we were proud of what we had accomplished.
